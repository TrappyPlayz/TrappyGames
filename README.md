## _TrappyGames_
##### Two-dimensional Executables packed with fun.

Welcome to TrappyGames! I'm Trappy, and I make games primarily in Python and Pygame. I wish to expand this website as I learn more about programming languages and I will post my projects on here. All my games are small games with a simple gameplay concept and it's mostly for my own practice. If you have some time to kill, i'd suggest installing and running one of these bad boys up and have some fun! Choose a game from the list below and follow the download instructions to begin having fun.

Criminals across town have procured shipments of illegal substances and are hiding it in a park. They are all armed to the teeth but the government is actively searching its databases while more and more criminals are trying to grab a peice of the substance. This substance gets you addicted on it and you eventually lose control of yourself. Once someone is fully affected by it, they are a threat to society with their unpredictable nature. While the government figures out who is handing these out, you must take out the people affected by the drug one by one. Be mindful, because sober criminals can spot your badge and stab you.

*WHY DOES THIS HAPPEN?* <br>
I don't have a publisher, so Windows thinks i'm someone sending a malicious file under my anonymous publishing name. It happens when a software isn't recognised by windows as it's not used by a lot of people.

Enjoy the game!
Volume warning when the game boots up :)

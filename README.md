## _TrappyGames_
##### Two-dimensional Executables packed with fun.

Welcome to TrappyGames! I'm Trappy, and I make games primarily in Python and Pygame. I wish to expand this website as I learn more about programming languages and I will post my projects on here. All my games are small games with a simple gameplay concept and it's mostly for my own practice. If you have some time to kill, i'd suggest installing and running one of these bad boys up and have some fun! Choose a game from the list below and follow the download instructions to begin having fun.
